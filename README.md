Hello
This is my first project at wiicamp company
----------------------
It was quite fun when I first used nodejs for my first project.
This is also the base code that my company still uses throughout the process.
It's a bit bad, but I still haven't found a more optimal solution when experience is still a number.
Haizz.But you can refer to them and add them to have your own way of writing
